# In this game, the player is in a land full of dragons. The dragons all live
# in caves with their large piles of collected treasure. Some dragons are
# friendly and share their treasure. Other dragons are hungry and eat any
# one who enters their cave. The player approaches two caves, one with a
# friendly dragon and the other with a hungry dragon, but doesnâ€™t know
# which dragon is in which cave. The player must choose between the two.
